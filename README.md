# FreeFi: Empowering freelancers with financial freedom through DeFi
## Mission:

FreeFi is transforming the lending landscape by providing secure, on-chain solutions for freelancers and communities. We leverage decentralized finance (DeFi) and Trust Credentials to offer instantaneous credit scoring, transparency, and accountability in the lending process. Join us in shaping a future of trustless lending, redefining financial access for DAOs, member organizations, and beyond.

## Problem:

Freelancers face significant challenges securing loans due to inconsistent work history, limiting access to conventional financing. This hinders their aspirations for stable living, homeownership, car leasing, and more.

## Key Insights:

- Upwork: 58% of freelancers struggle with financing due to unstable income.
- Federal Reserve: 70% of non-employer firms (often freelancers) face funding shortfalls.
- Freelancers Union: 63% of freelancers encounter mortgage difficulties due to irregular income.

## Solution:

FreeFi introduces a community-driven DeFi lending platform facilitating private, uncollateralized loans tailored for close-knit groups. Our innovative approach harnesses the power of DeFi to bring credit capital and investment returns directly to community members.
